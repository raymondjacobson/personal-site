      I'm a Junior at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rpi.edu">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> in <a target="_blank" href="http://troyny.gov/Home.aspx">Troy, NY</a> pursuing a dual major in Computer Engineering &amp; Computer Science for my love of electronics, computation, and problem solving.

      I grew up in Bethesda, MD, and attended elementary - high school at
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sidwell.edu">Sidwell Friends</a>, a Quaker school, in Washington, DC, where I played tennis, sang and played guitar for my band, and was engaged in community service. As a high school student, I co-led a $10,000 <a target="_blank" href="http://web.mit.edu/invent/"> Lemelson-MIT</a> grant winning <a target="_blank" href="projects/sfsinventeam/">green energy project</a> that generated electricity using gray water and was also highly invested as an engineer and web developer for our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sidwellrobotics.com">robotics team</a> that placed 10th at the MATE-ROV international competition in Houston, TX, at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab.

      Nowadays, beyond my college coursework, I'm a research assistant at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cats.rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Center for Automation Technologies and Systems</a>, a developer at the <a target="_blank" href="http://rcos.rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software</a>, a system administrator, secretary and webmaster for the <a target="_blank" href="http://gmweek.union.rpi.edu/" >GM Week</a> committee, a member of the RPI IEEE chapter, and a brother of <a target="_blank" href="http://ehzlxa.com/"> Lambda Chi Alpha - Epsilon Eta</a>.

      Ever since I was little, I've been driven by a curiosity and passion for creation, technology, nature, music, and design. That curiosity has fueled the projects I've done and is what drives me day by day to imagine. I'll keep you posted.
